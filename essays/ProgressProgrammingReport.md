**1. My programming skills have greatly improved.**

I believe that my understanding of programming has significantly improved since the start of this semester. Before taking this course, I had prior knowledge of the basic programming languages such as HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript. However, through Assignment 1, I was able to have a better understanding of how to apply the basic fundamentals of programming that I have learned into an application. Additionally, I was able to learn and figure out how the different functions and lines of code that I’ve used in my E-commerce store to operate by commenting every line of code I have written. 

**2. I am enthusiastic about programming.**

I can honestly say that I am enthusiastic about programming because it has always fascinated me ever since I heard about programming in high school. When I took AP Computer Science in high school and interned as a Web Developer, it really opened up a whole new world for me to explore about technology. However, throughout my programming experience, I have faced countless struggles and problems that made it impossible for me to move forward. Despite these minor setbacks, I’ve learned to persevere and move forward within my programming experience.

**3. I can do the practice WODs without looking at the screencast solutions.**

I believe that for the most part, I can do the practice WODs without referring back to the screencast solutions. However, there may be instances where I have to look up references because I simply do not remember everything about every programming language. On the contrary, when assigned a practice WOD, I always attempt to complete the WOD by myself without referring back to any form of reference. By doing this, I am able to assess myself on the programming knowledge that I do know and what other knowledge that I must improve upon.

**4. The labs have helped me to learn and I am able to complete them with confidence.**

I believe that the labs have significantly helped me learn and complete them with confidence mainly because it was an in-person type of environment rather than an online setting. Since the labs were in-person activities, I was able to easily follow along and have a better understanding of the content that was being discussed. However, there were some labs that were hard to follow along since those were areas in which I have never learned or had experience beforehand. The labs that were specifically slightly “difficult” to understand were the labs that explored the server-side processing. Overall, I believe that the labs were significantly helpful since they were hands on activities that took place in class.

**5. I feel ready to move to the next stage of complexity in programming (building small web applications).**

With Assignment 1 being complete, I feel that I am slightly ready to move forward to the next stage of complex programming. However, while going through Assignment 1, I realized that I still have a great deal to learn more about advanced programming and it feels that I have only scratched the surface of programming. Nevertheless, I believe that I have reached a milestone in my programming experience and I want to continue forward and push through any obstacle that comes my way. I would love to learn more about programming areas that I am unfamiliar with and apply the skills I’ve developed throughout my future career.

**6. I think the class can be improved to help my learning.**

Throughout my time in taking this course, I think that there are several things that can be improved upon to help undergraduate students to learn the material. One of the most important aspects that I believe is important to improve upon is having a solidified schedule of all the content that is being covered; this will make everything organized and everybody will be well prepared. During my time in this course, there were times in which I was lost in the schedule and I didn’t know specifically what and when the practice WODs, WODs, Readings, Labs, and Quizzes were truly due. I would compare the dynamic schedule on the website and the due dates on Laulima and they both would list different things and made me very confused. Clearing up the schedule with the students and TAs would help reduce stress for everyone and everything will be organized and run smoothly. Another aspect that I believe could help improve the people people in the class to learn better would be making sure to solidify the basics of the primary languages you are using; this would include HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for example. In doing so, having extra practice and constant repetition could help improve students learning capabilities. Before moving on into difficult and advanced programming concepts, ensure that the students have the basics and fundamentals solidified. This would help confusion in students when moving forward since they have the basics mastered and it will motivate them since they want to learn more than what they already know.

**7. There are things that work really well my learning in this class.**

Throughout my time in taking this course, I do believe that there are things that have helped my learning experience. One aspect that I believe helped improve my learning was going through the in-person Lab sessions. The Lab sessions were really important since that is where most students learn most from due to it being on hand exercises. Although some of the Lab sessions were slightly difficult to follow along, I found it significantly helpful when the professor explained the content slowly and ensured the students understood the lesson. However, there were times where class was about to end and we are rushing to complete the lab and go passed the scheduled class time. Although I enjoy the slow paced teaching, I think that it is important to stay on track and we would be able to complete more than what we have done with the slower pace. Another aspect that worked really well with my learning in class was the incorporation of practice WODs and WODs. It was my first time timing myself when practicing my coding skills, and with the WODs it really opened my eyes into different ways of testing my knowledge and improving on my programming skills. Overall, even though this course has its good and bad times, I have learned a great amount of programming knowledge and I hope to apply these skills into my future career.
