Aloha!

My name is Daniel Francis Barit and I am currently a Junior at the University of Hawaii at Manoa. I am currently majoring in Management Information Systems at the Shidler College of Business. I was born and raised here on the island of Oahu all of my life and loved every minute of living here. As for work experience, I am currently a IT Service Desk Technician at the University of Hawaii at West Oahu Campus. 

I decided to major in Management Information Systems because the world we live in is surround by technology. At a young age, I became very intrigued at how fast technology was growing rapidly to the point where it can be seen almost everywhere you go. As the years went by, my interest for technolgoy grew more but it was not until my senior year of highschool where I took a AP Computer Science course. During this time I also started talking to my cousin; who is a Freelancer Software Developer, which then changed my interest for technology to more of a passion. This was when my cousin recommended me to pursue a degree in Computer Science or Management Information Systems. 

At the beginning of my college career, I started as a Computer Science major. However, as time passed, I began to reflect more on my future and where I want to be in the future. I realized that I was more interested in the information systems/technology field rather than the striaght up programming 24/7 type of field. This was when I decided to switch majors and pursue a Management Information Systems pathway. Although, I did enjoy my time as a Computer Science major, it was not really my type of expertise. 

It's nice to meet you all and I look forward to what the semester holds!

Mahalo!
