**BrowserHistory6**

The main objective of BrowserHistory6 was essentially to utilize JavaScript to create a more “dynamic” web page more responsive on the client side. This dynamic web page was created by a combination of web development technologies known as the Dynamic HyperText Markup Language. The technologies used include a combination of HTML, JavaScript, CSS and the document object model (DOM). This assignment was to take the web page created from BrowserHistory3 and modify the web page to become more of a dynamic web page instead of a static web page, like the previous WODs. This exercise required use of JavaScript, as I have stated before. This would include adding JavaScript attributes such as incorporating buttons that lead to different HTML documents; as well as the mouse over element to where when the user hovers over a button, it displays the corresponding browser icon in the area below the buttons.

As for my experience with this WOD, I believed that everything worked really well. While going through the directions of the assignment first, it became a smooth and easy transition for me when it came to actually starting the task. In doing so, I was able to have a sense of what to expect and have a better understanding of what I need to do in order to complete this assignment. The most challenging part of this assignment was making sure I had the correct syntax, since I was trying to write JavaScript code inline with the HTML code. This was the part of the assignment that slowed me down by a few minutes since I was receiving error messages throughout VS Code and I was not able to figure it out right away. However, I was able to fix this problem by through my code line by line and making sure that everything was closing and concatenating with one another. Overall, I thought that I performed rather well for this assignment and it was a very fun exercise. 

To prepare for this WOD, I did a brief overview of the previous BrowswerHistory WODs by reviewing the instructions for each assignment as well as analyzing my code for each task. By doing this, I am solidifying the basic fundamentals of HTML and CSS so that I am not wasting time remembering the simple concepts found within these programming languages. Similarly, I also did a quick review of JavaScript from external sources in order to familiarize myself with the basic concepts that we have learned about JavaScript so far. Before performing any WOD, I always choose to review several materials relating to the assignment to prepare myself, rather than just going straight into the assignment blindly.

In regards to the next WOD, I believe that there is rarely anything in particular that I could do differently in preparing myself for upcoming WODs. Being able to review the material necessary prior to performing the WOD at hand, was a very effective for me to complete the assignment in an efficient way. However, the only thing that I could have done better to prepare myself for these WODs is to read the instructions very thoroughly before-hand instead of reading them while going through the assignment. In doing so, I would be able to research unfamiliar material before-hand and quickly review them so I won’t get stuck and waste time figuring it out. One thing that I might try differently for the next WOD would be using an external monitor or a desktop instead of a laptop since screen real estate is a huge factor when performing these WODs.
